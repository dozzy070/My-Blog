      <p>
        Hi, I’m a passionate web developer who enjoys building simple, clean, and
        useful web applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        This blog was created to share my journey in web development, document
        what I learn, and help others understand modern technologies like
        JavaScript, Node.js, Express, React, and MongoDB.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe in learning by building real projects and breaking down complex
        concepts into easy-to-understand explanations. Whether you’re just
        starting out or improving your skills, my goal is to provide content
        that is practical and beginner-friendly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks for stopping by — happy coding 🚀
      </p>
